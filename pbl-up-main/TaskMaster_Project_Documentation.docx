# TaskMaster: Advanced System Process Management Tool

## Problem Statement

### Background
In modern computing environments, efficient system resource management is crucial for optimal performance. Standard task managers provided by operating systems offer basic functionality but lack advanced features for comprehensive system monitoring, historical data analysis, and detailed resource tracking. Users often struggle to identify resource-intensive processes, understand system performance trends over time, and make informed decisions about system optimization.

### Specific Problems

1. **Limited Visibility into System Performance**
   - Standard task managers provide only instantaneous snapshots of system performance
   - Users cannot easily track performance trends over extended periods
   - There is no built-in capability to correlate system slowdowns with specific processes or events

2. **Inadequate Process Management**
   - Basic task managers offer limited control over processes
   - Users struggle to identify which processes are consistently consuming resources
   - There is minimal context provided about process behavior and resource consumption patterns

3. **Lack of Data-Driven Insights**
   - Users cannot access historical performance data to make informed decisions
   - There is no analytical capability to identify problematic processes or system bottlenecks
   - Performance optimization becomes guesswork rather than a data-driven process

4. **Poor Visualization of System Resources**
   - Standard tools often present data in tabular format without intuitive visualizations
   - Complex system interactions are difficult to understand without proper graphical representation
   - Resource usage patterns are not easily discernible from raw numbers

5. **Inefficient Troubleshooting Process**
   - When system performance issues occur, users lack the tools to investigate historical context
   - Intermittent problems are particularly difficult to diagnose without continuous monitoring
   - The relationship between different system resources (CPU, memory, disk) is not clearly presented

### Target Users
- System administrators managing multiple systems
- Power users who need to optimize system performance
- Developers troubleshooting application resource usage
- IT support professionals diagnosing system issues
- Regular users experiencing system performance problems
